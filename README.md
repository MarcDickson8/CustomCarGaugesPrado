# CustomCarGaugesPrado
Custom Prado 150 series Gauges using 8 Oled 128x64 pixel displays, NodeMCU ESP32 and TCA9548A I2C multiplexer. Started this project due to the fact that my Prado does not display Automatic Transmission temperatures, Transmission Lockup, and gear selection, from the factory. This Unit therefore requests this data from the ECU and displays the values as gauge graphics.
